TIPZOO is a software solution for data recording and analysis of fossil bone collections, specifically designed for zooarchaeologists’ needs. It uses a FileMaker interface (compatible with touchscreen devives) for data entry, combined with a R Shiny graphical interface for data analysis. TIPZOO is freely available on this website. It is intended to make data entry, analysis, and visualisation in Palaeolithic zooarchaeology easier, faster, and more reliable. It provides tools to effectively implement recently published complex coding systems and better control for undesirable intra- and inter-analyst variability, contributing therefore to greater reproducibility and reliability in data collection, and allows analysts to save time by automating several of the steps involved in data entry and analysis.
